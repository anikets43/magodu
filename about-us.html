				<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

					NGO dedicated towards empowerment of Magodu children. NSCT’s vision is to empower Magodu children to help them build
					a strong foundation for their better future. The mission of this trust is to equip children of the Magodu village to
					go beyond literacy and rudimentary skills with specified knowledge, skills and values to enable them to become good
					human beings and productive, socially responsible citizens and to achieve excellence in whatever they do. his effort
					is specifically focused on children in Magodu village, Sira Taluk, Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. We give special
					focus on girls and underprivileged Magodu children who cannot otherwise access or afford the quality education NSCT
					opens the door for rural children to successfully pursue higher studies and gainful employment. The holistic, activity-based
					approach nurtures children’s development beyond just academics, ensuring that students realize their full potential
					and learn in a joyful manner. With access to quality education, youth in Magodu can be empowered to take care of their
					own and the country’s development.</p>

				<h1>CURRENT PROBLEM</h1>
				<p>Magodu is a small village is located in Sira Tehsil of Tumkur district in Karnataka, India. It is situated 10km away
					from sub-district headquarter Sira and 60km away from district headquarter Tumkur. As per 2009 stats, Maagodu is the
					gram panchayat of Magodu village. The total geographical area of village is 1870.81 hectares. Magodu has a total population
					of around 3000 people and there are about 650 houses. Sira is nearest town to Magodu which is approximately 10km away.
					Magodu has suffered a lot last 15+ years due to lack of rain and completely dried out Due to which, many families have
					become extremely poor which inturn not able to afford basic education. Magodu has a small Govt. school which runs classes
					from nursery to 7th grade and around 150 kids studying in this school. For further education, kids need to goto near
					by big village or Sira town. Many kids stop their education at 7th grade for many reasons including but not limited
					to “lack of financial capability”, “lack of encouragement & motivation”, “lack of interest in learning and thinking
					higher” etc. Parents are not able to send their kids for further studies or better education likeNavodaya or higher
					education etc. just because they can’t afford the fees. Due to lack of quality education, culture and healthy environment
					for high thinking at both academic and other activities like sports etc, the children are not able to compete with urban
					children. As a result, these children are not able to see better future and stuck in the village going to work in fields.
					We @ NSCT, are trying to bridge this gap.</p>
				<br>
				<b>"EVERY MAGODU CHILD DESERVES A BETTER FUTURE"</b>
				<p>We @NSCT believe that lack of literacy is the root cause of many major problems in the country. We also believe that
					it is better to take care of our own places / areas within our reach first before solving the global problems. So, we
					selected our own village (Magodu) for the same purpose. Magodu is where we all were born and spent most of our childhood
					days.

						I was born in Magodu village on 18th January. I used to spend all my summer vacations in this village during my childhood.
						I was fortunate enough to be graduated and then work in both India and USA but my old friends in Magodu village could
						not continue their education for many reasons and mainly because of lack of encouragement, motivation, financial support
						and resources. After coming back from USA in 2014, I visited this village and felt bad seeing many kids are not getting
						the support they need for better future. So, decided this initiative to help whatever possible to these children and
						their better future along with wonderful support from my family and friends. I am currently working in Bangalore as
						a Director in a large global bank.
