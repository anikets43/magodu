                        I was born in Magodu village on 18th January. I used to spend all my summer vacations in this village during my childhood.
                        I was fortunate enough to be graduated and then work in both India and USA but my old friends in Magodu village could
                        not continue their education for many reasons and mainly because of lack of encouragement, motivation, financial support
                        and resources. After coming back from USA in 2014, I visited this village and felt bad seeing many kids are not getting
                        the support they need for better future. So, decided this initiative to help whatever possible to these children and
                        their better future along with wonderful support from my family and friends. I am currently working in Bangalore as
                        a Director in a large global bank.
